The goal of this toolkit is to make a simple solution for custom blocks, entities, items and guis.

Goals:
 - Toggleable automatic resource pack generation on startup
 - Custom blocks, entities, items and guis that can be easily and quickly made via .json files
 - BBModels can be used for custom models for all custom objects
 - PNG textures can be used for custom items textures

Todolist:
- [x] Resource pack generator
  - [x] Universal way of storing and saving the models after they are packed
    - [x] Other plugins can easily add folders to load assets from
  - [x] Pack creation should start from onLoad but not finalized until the first tick
    - [x] Should be run async
    - [x] Zip compress on finalize before event
    - [x] Local server should not be started until this finishes
    - [x] Broadcast resource pack finalized event
    - [x] Generate mcmeta automatically
  - [x] Automatic export to .minecraft folder if requested
  - [x] PNG textures converted to models
  - [x] Model Engine Support
  - [x] Option to add custom resources to any path in resource pack
  - [x] Fonts
    - [x] All png textures should have a font option (for GUIs and chat)
    - [x] Easy way of adding custom fonts without overriding base text
    - [x] On load, offsets and dimensions can be registered for any image being loaded to font
  - [x] Load everything from .json files if we are not generating anything
- [ ] Custom items (maybe able to steal from rpg toolkit)
  - [x] Load from json files
  - [x] Optionally use custom texture or model
